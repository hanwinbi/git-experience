## What I did in this repo?
This is a markdown only repo for my git learning experience. I will write down what Git command have excuted at first, then explain where and why I did it. All the document written by Vim. Hope you git beginner can also learn how to use Git by watch what I have down. Don`t hestate to tell me new things and point out what I did wrong. I would be really appreciate it.

If you are curious about why I write this README in English after you find out actually my native language is Chinese. Well, the truth is I JUST WANT.

## Init a repo
- `git init`: Create a repo folder under where you put your code, then `git init` in Terminal under this folder. You will see a `.git` file be created. If not, check what the hint says. The `.git` file track what you have done under this folder, which is the most important thing - version control, and it will be hidden unless you use `la` in Unix-like terminal or show hidden file. 
- `vi README.md`: All the things written by now in this markdown.
